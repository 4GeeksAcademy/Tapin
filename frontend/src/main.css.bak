/*
  Backup of legacy frontend/src/main.css

  The project now imports `styles.css` instead of `main.css`.
  This file is a lightweight placeholder containing a note; the
  original full content remains in Git history if you need it.

  If you want the full original contents restored here, tell me and
  I'll paste them into this backup file.

/* Legacy main.css backup - no active styles here. */

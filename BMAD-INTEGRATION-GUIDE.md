**How Research Findings, Visualizations, and Strategy Connect**

---

## 📊 THE COMPLETE PICTURE

### 1. RESEARCH FINDINGS → BMAD STRATEGY

**Research Insight:** "VolunteerMatch + Idealist merged (Sept 2025); dominant at scale but weak at neighborhood level"

**BMAD Response:** "Don't compete nationally. Own neighborhoods locally where 20%+ penetration = must-use platform"

---

**Research Insight:** "Nonprofits cite volunteer mismatch as #1 pain point (new in 2025)"

**BMAD Response:** "Lead with AI matching differentiation: 70%+ show-up vs. 45% baseline"

---

**Research Insight:** "78% of nonprofits prioritize ROI when selecting software"

**BMAD Response:** "Price at $200-300/mo (affordable for nonprofits; achievable margins for us)"

---

**Research Insight:** "70% of nonprofits don't use VolunteerMatch (recruiting manually with email lists)"

**BMAD Response:** "Huge whitespace opportunity; low adoption = low switching cost for existing tools"

## 📈 FINANCIAL VALIDATION

### TAM/SAM/SOM (From Research)

**TAM (Total Addressable Market):**

- Volunteer management platform market: $1.86B (2025)
- Tapin can address 1-2% = $18-36M opportunity

**SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):**

- US nonprofits needing volunteer management: ~50K
- Average spend: $200-300/mo = $2.4-3.6K/year
- SAM = 50K × $2.4K = $120M

**SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):**

- Year 1 target: 50-75 nonprofits × $2.4K = $120-180K ARR
- Year 3 target: 500-750 nonprofits (10-15% market share in focus cities) = $1.2-1.8M ARR
- SOM (realistic 5-year): $5-10M ARR

### Validation Path

```
Month 12: $60K ARR (0.05% SOM) - Proof of concept
Month 24: $500K ARR (0.4% SOM) - Profitable business
Month 36: $2M ARR (1.7% SOM) - Venture-scale opportunity
```

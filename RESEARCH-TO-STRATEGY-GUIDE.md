## 📊 Key Research Output Templates

### 1. User Persona Template (from research)

**Name:** [Segment name]  
**Motivation:** What drives this user?  
**Pain Point:** What problem are they trying to solve?  
**Current Solution:** How do they solve it today?  
**Platform Expectations:** What features matter most?  
**Willingness-to-Pay:** What would they pay for premium features?  
**Engagement Pattern:** One-time? Regular? Long-term?  
**Tapin Fit:** How well does current Tapin match their needs (1-10)?

**Example:**

```
Persona: "Sarah - Busy Professional Volunteer"
- Motivation: Social impact, skill-building, 2-3 hours/month
- Pain Point: Hard to find volunteer work that fits her schedule
- Current Solution: Email list from NPO she volunteers with
- Platform Expectations: Mobile-friendly, flexible commitment, impact tracking
- Willingness-to-Pay: Would pay $5-10/mo for premium features
- Engagement: 2-3 hours/month, prefers short-term projects
- Tapin Fit: 7/10 (missing mobile app, impact dashboard)
```

### 2. Competitive Positioning Matrix (from research)

Create a 2x2 matrix to see where Tapin sits:

```
                    Community-Focused
                          ↑
     Nextdoor          Tapin (aspirational)
                          ●

Local ←--------+--------→ National/Global
              Tapin
              (current)

TaskRabbit     VolunteerMatch
                          ↓
                   Task-Focused
```

**Questions this answers:**

- Is Tapin too generic (between categories)?
- Should we move toward "community" or "task"?
- What's our real competitive advantage?

### 4. Feature Prioritization Framework (from research)

For each proposed feature, score:

| Feature           | Market Need (1-10) | Competitive Gap (1-10) | Implementation Effort | Strategic Value | Priority |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- | --------------------- | --------------- | -------- |
| AI matching       | 8                  | 7                      | High                  | High            | P1       |
| Mobile app        | 9                  | 6                      | Very High             | Medium          | P2       |
| Background checks | 5                  | 8                      | Medium                | High            | P3       |
| Social features   | 6                  | 3                      | Medium                | Low             | P4       |

**Decision Rule:** (Market Need × Competitive Gap) / Implementation Effort = Priority Score

**Implementation Timeline:**

## 🎯 How Research Feeds Product Decisions

### Example: "Should Tapin focus on one model (volunteer OR services) or both?"

**Research Approach:**

1. Interview 15 volunteers: Do they use service features?
2. Interview 15 organizations: Do they post services?
3. Check Tapin usage data: Feature adoption of services vs volunteer
4. Analyze competitors: VolunteerMatch (volunteer-only) vs TaskRabbit (services-only) adoption

**Possible Findings:**

- **Finding A:** "Volunteers ignore services features; orgs rarely use it"
  → **Decision:** Focus 80% on volunteer features, sunset services
- **Finding B:** "Services features are used 40% of the time by power users"
  → **Decision:** Keep both, but invest in service provider acquisition
- **Finding C:** "The dual model is Tapin's unique value - users want 'one app for community'"
  → **Decision:** Double down on both, improve integration

## 📈 Measuring Research Impact

Track these metrics to validate research recommendations:

1. **Feature Adoption:** If research said "feature X will be used by 60% of users," track if it is
2. **Segment Growth:** If research said "focus on segment Y," track if GTM success matches
3. **Retention:** If research said "users want feature Z," did adding it improve retention?
4. **Revenue:** If research recommended pricing model, did it hit projections?

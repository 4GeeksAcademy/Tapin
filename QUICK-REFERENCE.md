## 💡 Handling Common Questions

**"Why dual model (volunteer + services)?"**  
Network effects. Volunteers discover services. Services get customers. Both sides grow.

**"How is this different from VolunteerMatch/TaskRabbit/Nextdoor?"**  
We're the only one combining both + focusing on geographic community.

**"How do you monetize?"**  
Multiple models under research. B2B SaaS for NPOs, commissions on services, premium features.

**"When's public launch?"**  
Phase 1 ready now. Phase 2 planned Q2 2026 after research + development.

**"What are the risks?"**  
Chicken-and-egg network effects. Mitigating by geographic focus + NPO partnerships first.

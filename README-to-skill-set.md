## 1. Objective  
To build a full-stack web application enabling users to discover, review, and engage with local businesses in their community. Business owners can create profiles and list their services, while users can browse, filter, review, and connect‚Äîall powered by your front-end (React, JavaScript, CSS) and back-end (Python, Flask, MySQL) expertise.

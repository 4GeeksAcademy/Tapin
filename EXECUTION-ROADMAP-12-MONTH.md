```
MUST HAVE:
✅ 70%+ show-up rate (critical success factor!)
✅ 50+ volunteer assignments made
✅ NPO satisfaction ≥ 4/5 stars

CRITICAL IF FAILED:
❌ Show-up <60% = algorithm needs redesign (ITERATE)

❌ Can't recruit 200+ volunteers = market issue (REASSESS)
```

### Phase 3 Gate (Month 8)

```
MUST HAVE:
✅ 30+ nonprofits paying ($200/mo)
✅ $20K MRR achieved
✅ 75%+ show-up rate maintained
✅ 50%+ volunteer retention

FINANCIAL:
✅ LTV/CAC > 3

```

---

## WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE AT EACH PHASE

### End of Phase 1 (Month 2)

> "We've validated that nonprofits desperately need better volunteer recruiting, and they're willing to pay $200-300/month for a solution. We have 3-5 committed pilot partners ready to test our MVP."

### End of Phase 2 (Month 5)

> "We've proven our AI matching works: 70%+ show-up rate vs. 45% industry baseline. Nonprofits are thrilled with the results. We're ready to charge for this."

### End of Phase 3 (Month 8)

> "We have 30+ paying nonprofit customers and $20K in monthly recurring revenue. The unit economics work. We're profitable on a per-neighborhood basis and ready to expand."

### End of Phase 4 (Month 12)

> "Tapin is operating profitably in 3-4 neighborhoods, demonstrating a repeatable playbook for expansion. We've built defensible competitive advantages (data moat, nonprofit lock-in) and have a clear path to Series A funding or sustainable self-funded growth."

---

## CONTINGENCY PLANS

### If Show-Up Rate Doesn't Reach 70%

```
Month 5 Assessment:
  If 60-70%: ITERATE → improve algorithm, investigate why mismatches
  If 50-60%: RE-EXAMINE → problem may be UX not algorithm
  If <50%: CONSIDER PIVOT → maybe matching isn't the key lever

Action: Conduct volunteer exit interviews (why didn't you show up?)
```

### If Can't Get 30+ Paying Nonprofits

```
Month 8 Assessment:
  If 15-30: Adjust pricing or sales strategy
  If 5-15: Model needs redesign (maybe B2C freemium is better)
  If <5: STOP and pivot to volunteer-first or services

Action: Intensify nonprofit sales outreach + gather pricing feedback
```

### If Expansion Doesn't Replicate

```
Month 12 Assessment:
  If 2 markets working but 3-4 struggling: Market selection issue
  If only 1 market working: Playbook may not be repeatable
  If none working: Something fundamentally changed

Action: Debug playbook; add support person for expansion cities
```

---

## DECISION TREE

```
START (Mo 1)
  └─ Phase 1: Validate nonprofit pain
     ├─ YES (3+ NPOs commit) → Go to Phase 2
     └─ NO → PIVOT to volunteers-first

Phase 2: Validate product-market fit
  └─ MVP launch with pilots
     ├─ 70%+ show-up? YES → Go to Phase 3
     ├─ 60-70% show-up → ITERATE (improve algorithm)
     └─ <60% show-up → PIVOT (matching not key lever)

Phase 3: Validate unit economics
  └─ Launch paid tiers
     ├─ 30+ paying NPOs? YES → Go to Phase 4
     ├─ 15-30 paying NPOs → ADJUST (pricing/sales)
     └─ <15 paying NPOs → PIVOT (model broken)

Phase 4: Expand & scale
  └─ Replicate in new markets
     ├─ 3-4 markets working? YES → Series A Ready ✅
     ├─ 2 markets working → CONSOLIDATE (double down on 2)
     └─ 1 market working → REFOCUS (single market perfection)

SUCCESS: Tapin is $60K+ MRR, multi-market, ready for Series A or scale sustainably
```

# QA Report â€“ Tapin Project

## 1. QA Plan Overview
- Review implementation plan and developer progress for alignment with requirements.
- Analyze user stories and acceptance criteria to ensure test coverage for all features.

## 2. Test Strategy
- **Unit Tests:**
  - Backend (Flask): Test models, API endpoints, authentication logic.
  - Frontend (React): Test components, forms, and state management.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - End-to-end flows: Registration, login, password reset, listings CRUD, map integration.
  - API and database integration.
- **Accessibility & Usability:**
  - WCAG AA compliance: Color contrast, keyboard navigation, alt text.
  - Responsive design checks on multiple devices.

## 3. Collaboration with Development
- Work with @dev to:
  - Write and maintain test cases for all major features.
  - Set up automated test scripts (pytest, React Testing Library, CI/CD integration).
  - Review code for quality, maintainability, and standards compliance.

## 4. Bug & Regression Tracking
- Use GitHub Issues/Project Board to log and track bugs, regressions, and test coverage gaps.
- Prioritize and assign issues for timely resolution.

## 5. Risks & Blockers
- Confirm test environment setup for both frontend and backend.
- Ensure all acceptance criteria are clear and testable.
- Identify any missing documentation or unclear requirements.

## 6. Next Steps
- Finalize test cases and scripts for MVP features.
- Integrate automated tests into CI/CD pipeline.
- Regularly review and update test coverage as features evolve.

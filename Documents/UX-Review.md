# UX Expert Review – Tapin Project

## 1. Mockup & Asset Review
- Mockups in `Design-Assets/` and `Tapin Design Mockups/` reflect the “Energetic Human” brand: bright blue palette, rounded typography, approachable layouts.
- Key screens (Home, Listings, Detail, Profile) are visually consistent with wireframes.

## 2. Wireframes, User Stories, and Requirements
- Wireframes define 6 core screens and navigation flows.
- User stories and requirements cover registration, authentication, CRUD, map integration, and responsive design.

## 3. Usability & Accessibility Assessment
- Layouts are mobile-first, with clear navigation and large tap targets.
- Color contrast appears strong, but verify all text/buttons meet WCAG AA (4.5:1 for text).
- Rounded sans-serif typography supports legibility and brand tone.
- Navigation is intuitive, but ensure all flows (e.g., password reset, sign-up) are represented in both mockups and wireframes.

## 4. Gaps & Inconsistencies
- Confirm all user stories have a corresponding screen or flow in the mockups (e.g., password reset, email confirmation, error states).
- Ensure map integration and sign-up flows are visually represented.
- Accessibility: Add visible focus indicators, ARIA labels, and alt text for icons/images.

## 5. Actionable Recommendations
- Update mockups to include any missing flows (error, loading, confirmation screens).
- Test color contrast and adjust if needed for accessibility.
- Add micro-interactions (button feedback, loading spinners) for a polished feel.
- Document navigation patterns and component usage for dev handoff.
- Consider a style guide page summarizing color, typography, and spacing tokens.

## 6. Next Steps
- Update mockups and wireframes to address gaps.
- Share finalized assets and design tokens with the development team.
- Collaborate with @dev and @qa to ensure UI implementation matches design intent and accessibility standards.

# Prompt for @dev (Authentication Implementation)

You are the Full Stack Developer for the Tapin project. Your next objectives are:

1. Implement user authentication features in both backend (Flask) and frontend (React):
   - User registration with encrypted password storage (bcrypt or argon2)
   - User login with session or JWT-based authentication
   - Password reset flow (request, email, reset)
2. Design and document the database schema for users and authentication-related data.
3. Build and test the corresponding API endpoints in Flask.
4. Create React forms and flows for registration, login, and password reset.
5. Ensure all authentication flows are secure and user-friendly.
6. Update API documentation and setup instructions as you build.
7. Notify @qa when authentication features are ready for testing.

Summarize your implementation plan and note any technical questions or blockers for the team.
